You don't have to install Maven because Maven Wrapper (https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper) is used. On any system following command is sufficient as long as Java is given ( minimum Version : 11): ./mvnw On Unix based systems this is the exact filename of the script that is executed. On Windows it's the mvnw.cmd script (anyway you do not have to specify the extension that's why it looks and feel identical on all systems). Maven Profiles There are two profiles; one for Windows and one for Unix based systems. The main reason for two profiles is that the code coverage is different since not every test can be executed on every system (example: The UnixShellTaskTest can run on Unix based systems only). The reason to use a profile in general is to be able to define default goals, so you do not have to specify them on command line each time (convenience reason). Default goals The default goals are: clean package javadoc:jar verify clean - removes the target folder package - includes all previous goals like resource filtering, compiling and running tests. The package is combining the concrete jar with all dependencies into one jar that allows to use it standalone. javadoc:jar - generate the Javadoc HTML documentation and the javadoc jar. verify - is running all static code analysis (including the analysis of the code coverage).

The build is written in YAML format and is called workflow . Workflows have to be located at .github/workflows. The workflow for Hyperion is in the file .github/workflows/hyperion-build-actions.yml . Each time you push your changes remote the workflow automatically starts. The success is then visible by an success/failure icon on each location where the commit is shown. The history for all actions (including the currently running one) you can find here: https://github.com/thomas-lehmann-private/hyperion/actions. The file is really simple and the Github actions in general have good documentation. For the code coverage the usage is well documentated by the integration itself. The whole build is organized via a matrix build. All combinations of the values of the existing lists define one build job. When something goes wrong you can read the logs online at the individual build. Please note : The --batch-mode is really important to reduce the verbose output of the download operation for each single artefact. Jenkins You also can run your project locally via Jenkins. You simply create a pipelineline specifying the file url to your local repository. You shoudl have some plugins installed like Jacoco , Javadoc , AnsiColor , Built Timeout , Green Balls and Workspace Cleanup . The Jenkins job presents you out-of-the-box trend graphs for your tests, the code coverage and the static code analyses. Very awesome. The Jenkinsfile (default when you create a pipeline job) is given in the repository. I hope you agree: It's a small file. How to handle things In general violations will break the build, and the common expectation is that issues are correctly resolved. When a Jacoco error is raised it does mean that you have added coded without testing it. Decreasing the limit is not acceptable. When your code coverage does get better please increase those limits. When Checkstyle , PMD or Spotbug raise an error for src/main/java the expectation is to fix it without any suppression in 99% of all cases. For the 1% where you think you have to suppress it the reason has to be well documented. For some sort of error like magic numbers or repeated string literals happening in Unittests it's mostly ok when you use suppression. It should never happen that the code is overwhelmed with suppression.

Nevertheless it should be documented how it works... Defining an option The creation of an option is best explained by an example: final var option = CliOption.builder() .setLongName(\"file\") .setShortName(\"f\") .setDescription(\"Provide document to process\") .setType(OptionType.STRING) .setRequired(true) .setRepeatable(false) .build(); The build() will throw an CliException when the validation of your definition has failed. Long names The field is required. A long name has to be lower case. You can combine as maximum three so called sub names namea-nameb-namec by dashes. Each subname has to start with a letter; then also numbers may be used (no other characters). it's not allowed to have less than 2 characters and no more than 15 characters. You can use the long name in two forms: --name=value --name value Short names The field is option (null or empty counts as not set). A short name can be upper case or lower case. You are allowed to define one character only (length equal to 1). You can use the short name in two forms: -v1234 -v 1234 Description The field is required It cannot be null and also not be empty The length may not exceed 40 characters. Keep in mind that this description should help the user. Repeatable The default is false (not repeatable). A repeatable option means that under given name a list of values is stored. The repeatable flag is shown in the help. Required The default is false (not required). A required field means that you have to specify the parameter. The required flag is shown in the help. Special scenario : consider a --help (which should be optional). If you (as an example) specify the option --file as required the CliParser will throw a CliException if you just use --help. You can define a command and with such an option (example: run). Only if you use that command you also have to specify the required option. Type The types are boolean, string, integer, double and path (for now). The default is string. The boolean means that you don't expect a value. The types are currently used for the help only to show what value is expected. Validation The build() function checks the rules as described before throwing a CliException when validation has failed. Defining a command The creation of a command is working pretty the same way as for the options. The definition of the command options is exactly the same thing. final var command = CliCommand.builder() .setName(\"run\") .setDescription(\"processing a document with tasks\") .addOption(fileOption) .build(); Name The name is required. The name should have at least two characters, and the length must not exceed 10 characters. The name has to be lower case. Description The field is required It cannot be null and also not be empty Option you can call addOption (several times) to add one option. you can call addAllOption (several times) to add a list of options. Validation The build() function checks the rules as described below throwing a CliException when validation has failed. checking for name and description checking for options a long name may exist once only a short name may exist once only a description may exist once only The option list The option list (CliOptionList) is special class keeping a list of options working with the builder options as already seen for the other classes. The build() function finally does also the validation: a long name may exist once only a short name may exist once only a description may exist once only These option list is required for the parser. Using the parser The parser does parse the command line arguments. final var parser = CliParser.builder() .setGlobalOptions(globalOptions) .setCommands(commands) .build(); final var result = parser.parse(arguments); Global options You set the list of global options (see option list - CliOptionList). Commands You have two options: using setCommands to set a list of commands (old commands are lost). using addCommand (several times) to add one command. Validation when parsing While parsing the command line arguments further validation is done: required options that are missing repeated options that are not defined repeatable if you use more than once command unknown options unknown commands Please note : You have to use global options before any command If you want to use required options don't use them on global options otherwise you run into problems when trying to use --help (as an example). Simply define a command for it. Using the result When the parsing is fine you get an instance of type CliResult and you three information are available then: with getGlobalOptions() you get a map where the key is the long name of the option the value is a list; if the option is repeatable it contains more than one value. same for getCommandOptions() . with getCommandName() you get the command. It's on you how you handle it. Help printer The setup of the help printer works similar as the parser. In addition to the defined options and commands you specify the execution, the product version, the build timestamp and the author: private void printHelp() throws CliException { final var helpPrinter = CliHelpPrinter.builder() .setExecution(\"java -jar \" + this.properties.getProperty(PROPERTY_FINAL_NAME) + \".jar\") .setProductVersion(this.properties.getProperty(PROPERTY_PRODUCT_VERSION)) .setBuildTimestamp(this.properties.getProperty(PROPERTY_BUILD_TIMESTAMP)) .setAuthor(this.properties.getProperty(PROPERTY_AUTHOR)) .setGlobalOptions(this.globalOptions) .setCommands(this.commands) .build(); helpPrinter.print(LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"HELP\")::info); } The code is extracted from the Hyperion application as I'm using it iself.

Please refer to official Docker documentation for details on it. It's about the Docker container task. However a few things to mention here: Docker is an external tool that must exist otherwise you cannot use the task; even more the Hyperion tool will throw an error when the Docker tool has not been found. The default is to run Docker container with Unix images. On Windows you are able to switch to Windows container so you could run Windows batch code inside the Docker container. Usually you can switch to either use the one paltform or the other platform but not both at same time. From documentation, it seems an experimental feature that can be turned on allowing you to specify the parameter --platform with the values windows or unix so you could use both at same time. Since it is experimental and I cannot rely on yet that this is turned on by default I don't generate that parameter; means you cannot use both at same time for now. Also on Windows you have to be aware that sharing a drive is to be adjusted in the settings of Docker. Be aware that right now Hyperion differs two mounts which are currently done automatically: the mount of the current working directory (as /work) the mount of the path usually used for generating temporary files and folders by the standard Java API. At least it means you might have to allow more than one Windows drive to be shared with the Docker container . Since you probably want to run Hyperion processing automatically it is advisable to adjust this in advance otherwise the Docker process is trying to ask you via Dialog. The minimal example It's really easy and doesn't differ much from other task. Following details: The parameter image-name is required and should be the name of the Docker image. The parameter imager-version is optional and should be the version of the Docker image. If not specified the version is set to latest . The parameter platform is optional and can be either windows or unix . If not specified the platform is set to unix . It does have the effect that the generated temporary script - that will be executed by the Docker container - is either passed to cmd /c or sh -c . As already mentioned you cannot use both platforms in one document since --platform is not yet generated. So you have to decide which platform Docker should use by switching to it manually.

Please refer to official Docker documentation for details on it. It's about the Docker container task. However a few things to mention here: Docker is an external tool that must exist otherwise you cannot use the task; even more the Hyperion tool will throw an error when the Docker tool has not been found. The default is to run Docker container with Unix images. On Windows you are able to switch to Windows container so you could run Windows batch code inside the Docker container. Usually you can switch to either use the one paltform or the other platform but not both at same time. From documentation, it seems an experimental feature that can be turned on allowing you to specify the parameter --platform with the values windows or unix so you could use both at same time. Since it is experimental and I cannot rely on yet that this is turned on by default I don't generate that parameter; means you cannot use both at same time for now. Also on Windows you have to be aware that sharing a drive is to be adjusted in the settings of Docker. Be aware that right now Hyperion differs two mounts which are currently done automatically: the mount of the current working directory (as /work) the mount of the path usually used for generating temporary files and folders by the standard Java API. At least it means you might have to allow more than one Windows drive to be shared with the Docker container . Since you probably want to run Hyperion processing automatically it is advisable to adjust this in advance otherwise the Docker process is trying to ask you via Dialog.","title":"Docker container task"},{"location":"docker-container/#the-minimal-example","text":"It's really easy and doesn't differ much from other task. Following details: The parameter image-name is required and should be the name of the Docker image. The parameter imager-version is optional and should be the version of the Docker image. If not specified the version is set to latest . The parameter platform is optional and can be either windows or unix . If not specified the platform is set to unix . It does have the effect that the generated temporary script - that will be executed by the Docker container - is either passed to cmd /c or sh -c . As already mentioned you cannot use both platforms in one document since --platform is not yet generated. So you have to decide which platform Docker should use by switching to it manually.
