# Welcome to the Hyperion Task Processor

The powerful and free task processing tool

## Main goals

For the main goals and the current progress please have a look
at current milestone.
You can see there which issues are closed and which ones are in the queue.
The list of open issues is not necessarily complete, it means there might be further
features added to that milestone.

## Status

The tool is not yet production ready.
I cannot tell you a release date the moment, but I'm constantly developing on it in my free time.
The current issue(s) I'm working on are pinned and can be seen at the top of the issue list.

## Issues

If you are using the tool and find things please report an issue but
please check before that the issue isn't already there. The issue tracker is [here](https://github.com/thomas-lehmann-private/hyperion-task-processor/issues).

Please do not assign tags (please leave that to me). Thank you.
Please also provide concrete examples that I'm able to reproduce the problem.

## Discussions

## Documentation

The current documentation will be [here](https://thomas-lehmann-private.github.io/hyperion-task-processor/).
Have a look at the top menu under menu entry **Index**. As mentioned the tool is not yet
production ready - so please be patient - there will be detailed documentation **and** examples.

## The name

"*In Greek mythology, Hyperion was one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia (Earth)*" <br/>
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan)). <br/>
A nice name and I like mythology - just a little bit; that's all.
