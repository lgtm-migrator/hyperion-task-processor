# Provide Python task

### Document meta data

- **Type**: Requirement
- **Id**: 17
- **Context**: task feature
- **Milestone**: 2.0.0

### Description

As a **devops engineer** you should be able to write a Python script as task. The script code can be
embedded in the document or referencing a valid path and filename. The standard parameters are those
of a coded task.

### Constraints

The Python command line tool is required. The search path must be set.

### Criticality and Risk

!!! warning The possibility of something going wrong, and the associated consequences of failure,
are highly dependent on the user of the Hyperion tool, as using the tool requires that the results
be verified in a test environment.

    There is a risk that the user will be blocked in his work if the tool does not work
    properly, but there is no guarantee due to the license. Nevertheless, the author is
    extremely interested in correcting all reported errors in the near future.
